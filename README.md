## Background and Resources

This is my first attempt at creating a d3.js interactive multi-line chart. I will be following along with [this tutorial](http://datawanderings.com/2019/11/01/tutorial-making-an-interactive-line-chart-in-d3-js-v-5/) to recreate [this chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/covid-confirmed-cases-since-100th-case). My goal is to add more functionality as I become better versed in d3.

I just learned the basics of d3.js from [this source](https://square.github.io/intro-to-d3/) and [this source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-d3-js-in-5-minutes-c5ec29fb0725/). While I have a background in HTML and CSS, I do not know javascript and do not use it regularly (see: self-proclaimed Pythonista in LinkedIn headline). This project is for learning purposes only and is not intended to inform in any way on the COVID-19 crisis.
